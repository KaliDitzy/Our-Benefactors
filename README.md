# Our Benefactors
A Hearts of Iron IV total conversion, based in the Half-Life universe.

# Current Progress
Currently, the project is hardly even 1% complete, there are some basic early mechanics in place but as it stands not even Europe is in a playable (or rather, fun) state. In fact, most of the world doesn't even have countries to play.

# Contributing
Feel free to contribute to what you believe needs help, I plan to create a Discord server in the future if enough contributions come, but until then you can just message me on Discord @ kaliditzy.
