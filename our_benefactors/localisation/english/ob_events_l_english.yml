  resistance_decisions.1.d: "Recent tensions in [ROOT.GetNameDef] have come to a head, where regular citizens can no longer bear the hostilities between the local administration of [ROOT.GetLeader] and them. The crossfire between attempts at subjugating resistance members have escalated to an almost irresponsible degree, displacing families and destroying long-standing loyalties to the Combine. This is where it ends, either for the Combine's grip on the region or humanity's hopes and aspirations."

  resistance_events.3.t: "Emerging Agitation"
  resistance_events.3.d: "It seems that a Combine regime is not unilaterally agreed upon by all, while we believe we have their best interests at heart I don't think our people see it the same way."

  major_resistance_events.3.t: "Citadel Destruction Opportunity"
  major_resistance_events.3.d: "We have a unique opportunity to destroy the pride and joy of the Combine occupation on Earth, as well as their most important source of influence and decay upon Humanity. We could destroy it and free our people of its shadow or perhaps weaponize it for our own gain."
  major_resistance_events.3a: "Destroy it!"
  major_resistance_events.3b: "Let's keep it."

  citadel.1.t: "The Citadel is Complete"
